(fig. 5 . 1 6 )  the einstein universe is like a cylinder:  it is finite in space and constant in  time. because of its finite size, it can  rotate at less than the speed of light  everywhere.  \",\n",

       " 'sentence_chunk': 'the phenomenon of interference between particles has been crucial to our understanding of the structure of atoms, the basic units of chemistry and biology and the building blocks out of which we, and everything around us, are made.at the beginning of this century it was thought that atoms were rather like the planets orbiting the sun, with electrons (particles of negative electricity) orbiting around a central nucleus, which carried positive electricity.the attraction between the positive and negative electricity was supposed to keep the electrons in their orbits in the same way that the gravitational attraction between the sun and the planets keeps the planets in their orbits.the trouble with this was that the laws of mechanics and electricity, before quantum mechanics, predicted that the electrons would lose energy and so spiral inward until they collided with the nucleus.this would mean that the atom, and indeed all matter, should rapidly collapse to a state of very high density.a partial solution to this problem was found by the danish scientist niels bohr in 1913.he suggested that maybe the electrons were not able to orbit at just any distance from the central nucleus but only at certain specified distances.if one also supposed that only one or two electrons could orbit at any one of these distances, this would solve the problem of the collapse of the atom, because the electrons could not spiral in any farther than to fill up the orbits with the least distances and energies.this model explained quite well the structure of the simplest atom, hydrogen, which has only one electron orbiting around the nucleus.but it was not clear how one ought to extend it to more complicated atoms.',\n",

      "t chapter 6 black holes he term black hole is of very recent origin.it was coined in 1969 by the american scientist john wheeler as a graphic description of an idea that goes back at least two hundred years, to a time when there were two theories about light: one, which newton favored, was that it was composed of particles; the other was that it was made of waves.we now know that really both theories are correct.by the wave/particle duality of quantum mechanics, light can be regarded as both a wave and a particle.under the theory that light is made up of waves, it was not clear how it would respond to gravity.but if light is composed of particles, one might expect them to be affected by gravity in the same way that cannonballs, rockets, and planets are.at first people thought that particles of light traveled infinitely fast, so gravity would not have been able to slow them down, but the discovery by roemer that light travels at a finite speed meant that gravity might have an important effect.on this assumption, a cambridge don, john michell, wrote a paper in 1783 in the philosophical transactions of the royal society of london in which he pointed out that a star that was sufficiently massive and compact would have such a strong gravitational field that light could not escape: any light emitted from the surface of the star would be dragged back by the star’s gravitational attraction before it could get very far.michell suggested that there might be a large number of stars like this.although we would not be able to see them because the light from them would not reach us, we would still feel their gravitational attraction.\n"

      "t chapter 6 black holes he term black hole is of very recent origin.it was coined in 1969 by the american scientist john wheeler as a graphic description of an idea that goes back at least two hundred years, to a time when there were two theories about light: one, which newton favored, was that it was composed of particles; the other was that it was made of waves.we now know that really both theories are correct.by the wave/particle duality of quantum mechanics, light can be regarded as both a wave and a particle.under the theory that light is made up of waves, it was not clear how it would respond to gravity.but if light is composed of particles, one might expect them to be affected by gravity in the same way that cannonballs, rockets, and planets are.at first people thought that particles of light traveled infinitely fast, so gravity would not have been able to slow them down, but the discovery by roemer that light travels at a finite speed meant that gravity might have an important effect.on this assumption, a cambridge don, john michell, wrote a paper in 1783 in the philosophical transactions of the royal society of london in which he pointed out that a star that was sufficiently massive and compact would have such a strong gravitational field that light could not escape: any light emitted from the surface of the star would be dragged back by the star’s gravitational attraction before it could get very far.michell suggested that there might be a large number of stars like this.although we would not be able to see them because the light from them would not reach us, we would still feel their gravitational attraction.\n",

      "35 t h e s h a p e o f t i m e general relativity combines the time dimension with the three dimensions of space to form what is called spacetime (see page 3 3 , fig.2 .3 ) .the theory incorporates the effect of gravity by saying that the distribution of matter and energy in the universe warps and distorts spacetime, so that it is not flat.objects in this spacetime try to move in straight lines, but because spacetime is curved, their paths appear bent.they move as if affected by a gravitational field. as a rough analogy, not to be taken too literally, imagine a sheet of rubber.one can place a large ball on the sheet to represent the sun.the weight of the ball will depress the sheet and cause it to be curved near the sun.if one now rolls little ball bearings on the sheet, they won't roll straight across to the other side but instead will go around the heavy weight, like planets orbiting the sun (fig.\n",

(remember that the event horizon is the path in space-time of light that is trying to escape from the black hole, and nothing can travel faster than light.)one could well say of the event horizon what the poet dante said of the entrance to hell: “all hope abandon, ye who enter here.”anything or anyone who falls through the event horizon will soon reach the region of infinite density and the end of time.general relativity predicts that heavy objects that are moving will cause the emission of gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of space that travel at the speed of light.these are similar to light waves, which are ripples of the electromagnetic field, but they are much harder to detect.they can be observed by the very slight change in separation they produce between neighboring freely moving objects.a number of detectors are being built in the united states, europe, and japan that will measure displacements of one part in a thousand million million million (1 with twenty-one zeros after it), or less than the nucleus of an atom over a distance of ten miles.like light, gravitational waves carry energy away from the objects that emit them.one would therefore expect a system of massive objects to settle down eventually to a stationary state, because the energy in any movement would be carried away by the emission of gravitational waves.
