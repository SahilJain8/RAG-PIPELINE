       "'<s>[INST] \"Based on the following context , please answer the query.\\n    query: What are some proposed theories for what lies beyond the event horizon of a black hole?\\n    context: - b chapter 7 black holes ain’t so black efore 1970, my research on general relativity had concentrated mainly on the question of whether or not there had been a big bang singularity.however, one evening in november that year, shortly after the birth of my daughter, lucy, i started to think about black holes as i was getting into bed.my disability makes this rather a slow process, so i had plenty of time.at that date there was no precise definition of which points in space-time lay inside a black hole and which lay outside.i had already discussed with roger penrose the idea of defining a black hole as the set of events from which it was not possible to escape to a large distance, which is now the generally accepted definition.it means that the boundary of the black hole, the event horizon, is formed by the light rays that just fail to escape from the black hole, hovering forever just on the edge (fig.7.1).it is a bit like running away from the police and just managing to keep one step ahead but not being able to get clear away!suddenly i realized that the paths of these light rays could never approach one another.if they did, they must eventually run into one another.\\n- 125 p r e d i c t i n g t h e f u t u r e intersecting branes black hole measured.because of this, it is not possible to predict the spin or the wave function of the particle that escapes.it can have different spins and different wave functions, with various probabilities, but it doesn\\'t have a unique spin or wave function.thus it would seem that our power to predict the future would be further reduced.the classical idea of laplace, that one could predict both the positions and the velocities of particles, had to be modified when the uncertainty prin- ciple showed that one could not accurately measure both positions and velocities.however, one could still measure the wave function and use the schrodinger equation to predict what it should be in the future.this would allow one to predict with certainty one combina- tion of position and velocity—which is half of what one could predict according to laplace\\'s ideas.we can predict with certainty that the particles have opposite spins, but if one particle falls into the black hole, there is no prediction we can make with certainty about the (fig.4.22) black holes can be thought of as the intersections of p-branes in the extra dimensions of spacetime.information about the internal states of black holes would be stored as waves on the p- branes.\\n- around the black hole: objects, such as unwary astronauts, can fall through the event horizon into the black hole, but nothing can ever get out of the black hole through the event horizon. (remember that the event horizon is the path in space-time of light that is trying to escape from the black hole, and nothing can travel faster than light.)one could well say of the event horizon what the poet dante said of the entrance to hell: “all hope abandon, ye who enter here.”anything or anyone who falls through the event horizon will soon reach the region of infinite density and the end of time.general relativity predicts that heavy objects that are moving will cause the emission of gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of space that travel at the speed of light.these are similar to light waves, which are ripples of the electromagnetic field, but they are much harder to detect.they can be observed by the very slight change in separation they produce between neighboring freely moving objects.a number of detectors are being built in the united states, europe, and japan that will measure displacements of one part in a thousand million million million (1 with twenty-one zeros after it), or less than the nucleus of an atom over a distance of ten miles.like light, gravitational waves carry energy away from the objects that emit them.one would therefore expect a system of massive objects to settle down eventually to a stationary state, because the energy in any movement would be carried away by the emission of gravitational waves. (\\n- t chapter 6 black holes he term black hole is of very recent origin.it was coined in 1969 by the american scientist john wheeler as a graphic description of an idea that goes back at least two hundred years, to a time when there were two theories about light: one, which newton favored, was that it was composed of particles; the other was that it was made of waves.we now know that really both theories are correct.by the wave/particle duality of quantum mechanics, light can be regarded as both a wave and a particle.under the theory that light is made up of waves, it was not clear how it would respond to gravity.but if light is composed of particles, one might expect them to be affected by gravity in the same way that cannonballs, rockets, and planets are.at first people thought that particles of light traveled infinitely fast, so gravity would not have been able to slow them down, but the discovery by roemer that light travels at a finite speed meant that gravity might have an important effect.on this assumption, a cambridge don, john michell, wrote a paper in 1783 in the philosophical transactions of the royal society of london in which he pointed out that a star that was sufficiently massive and compact would have such a strong gravitational field that light could not escape: any light emitted from the surface of the star would be dragged back by the star’s gravitational attraction before it could get very far.michell suggested that there might be a large number of stars like this.although we would not be able to see them because the light from them would not reach us, we would still feel their gravitational attraction.\\n- 62 t h e u n i v e r s e i n a n u t s h e l l information falling into black hole information re-stored the area formula for the entropy—or number of internal states—of a black hole suggests that information about what falls into a black hole may be stored like that on a record, and played back as the black hole evaporates.

( - perhaps the most impressive are the giant black holes that occur in the centers of galaxies and quasars (fig.4 .1 5 ) . the properties of black holes that have been discussed thus far don\\'t raise any great problems with determinism.time will come to an end for an astronaut who falls into a black hole and hits the sin- gularity.however, in general relativity, one is free to measure time at different rates in different places.one could therefore speed up the astronaut\\'s watch as he or she approached the singularity, so that it still registered an infinite interval of time.on the time-and-distance diagram (fig.4 .1 4 ) , the surfaces of constant values of this new time would be all crowded together at the center, below the point where the singularity appeared.
